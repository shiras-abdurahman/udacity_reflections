How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Diff returns line by line comparison of two text file.
Thereby we identify the lines which are added, deleted and modified
in the new version compared to old version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

We can go back to code history and make changes and learn from mistakes.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros
We can create commits which are logical and reflect the changes like adding a feature 
or fixing a bug.

Cons
If we forget the commit, we loose track.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


For programmers need to track multiple files!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Ans: git log lists the commmits. With two commit ids we can see the changes made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Ans: Since we can revert to the previous commits.
