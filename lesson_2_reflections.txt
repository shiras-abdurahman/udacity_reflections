What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Init creates a git repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans: Staging area is the space between working directory and git repository. It contains the
copy of recent commit until we add changes to it.
Having staging area gives us more control in adding, deleting and modifying the 
files.
